# js-add-app
A simple JS app to add an array of numbers.
This app is targeted at adding an array of numbers. It has an input box where a user can type in the numbers to be added and four buttons for manipulating the numbers entered into the input box. The add button adds the numbers entered to the array, the remove button removes the last number that was passed into the array, the reset button clears out the array while the submit button adds numbers that are present in the array.
As the user adds the numbers to the array, the list of numbers entered are displayed on the app so the user can be sure the number has been included in the array. Additionally, all other buttons apart from the add button are disabled until the first number is added to the array. 
As at first commit, the app is yet to be styled as the focus was on functionality first. Overall, I think the app works as expected.
